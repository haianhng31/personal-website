        <p style={{fontSize: 16}}>Social media, including LinkedIn, isn't my thing. It's all about showing off the highlights without the backstory behind them, and it can make you feel pretty crappy. Instead, I'm all about keeping it real. I'm documenting my journey in learning Computer Science, no hiding, no sugarcoating. I'm sharing everythingâ€”what I've done, what I'm doing, how I feel. I want to show people the real deal, what it's really like. My journey with this newsletter started exactly three months after I wrote my first line of Python code, and that's what my newsletter is all about.</p>
